==============

Assignments of the Algorithms 1 course offered by Princeton University on Coursera.org


Assignment 1
  Writing a program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation, utilizing WeightedQuickUnionUF algorithm(provided in algs4.jar)
  
Assignment 2
  Writing a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists
  
Assignment 3
  Writing a program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points.
  The problem: Given a set of N distinct points in the plane, draw every (maximal) line segment that connects a subset of 4 or more of the points.

Assignment 4
  Writing a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm.
  
  
Note:
1. All the Java classes are placed in {default package} as the course required
2. The code requires the 2 course-supplied-library stdlib.jar and algs4.jar to run
3. My solutions have received a grade of 100% for each of the assignments, passing all the correctess and performance tests
